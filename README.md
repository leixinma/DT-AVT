**Digital Thread Analysis and Visualization Tool (DT-AVT)**

# About 
This repository is the analysis and visualization tool used in the following articles and thesis:

- Singh V (2019) Towards a Feedback Design Process Using Digital Thread. PhD Thesis, MIT
- Singh V, Willcox K (2018) Engineering Design with Digital Thread. AIAA Journal 56 (11):4515â€“4528, DOI 10.2514/1.J057255

The Digital Thread, Digital Twins, and the design process at various stages can be analyzed and visualized at the component level within this tool. Different policies can be compared (including designs) and their performances can be quantified. The tool is written in the context of the example design problem presented in the above works though it can be readily modified to suite other design scenarios. All code is written in MATLAB R2018b on a Windows 10 64-bit machine.
